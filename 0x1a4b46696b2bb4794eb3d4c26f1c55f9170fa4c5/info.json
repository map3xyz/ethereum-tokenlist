Its treasury is supported by contributions from Bybit and the virtuous cycle of value created by its AEs and partner labs. When you hold $BIT, you’re not only getting a stake in the massive growth potential of BitDAO, but the AEs it’s helping accelerate. Your $BIT gives you voting power to help direct how treasury funds are allocated and the terms of the funding.",
